# React Components I Like

This is a quick space for me to keep track of interesting react componenets and hooks from third parties.

## UI



## Hooks

[useDebouce](https://github.com/xnimorz/use-debounce) - A simple debouncing hook. Can help stop unnecesary calls to an API, e.g. if a user is typing in a search box, can wait until user has finished typing before sending off a call to the API.
